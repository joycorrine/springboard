# Predicting the Age of Abalones

Abalone is a common name for any of a group of small to very large marine snails. 
    The age of an abalone can be determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of 
    rings through a microscope. The age can then be calculated in years by adding 1.5 to the number of rings on the shell.

Counting the rings of an abalone shell can be an incredibly tedious and time-consuming task, so 
    I am going to attempt to build a regression model that can accurately predict the rings (age) of 
    an abalone based on knowing the shells' physical features.

### Source

To build my model, I’ll be using a dataset on abalone shells from the University of California, Irvine:

### Building a Predictive Model

For this dataset, I built multiple models in order to identify the best performing one at predicting the age of an 
    abalone shell. I tested with multiple linear regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boost, 
    support vector regression, and K nearest neighbors.

I used RMSE (root mean squared error) to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of my models, 
    and ultimately, my multiple linear regression model performed the best with an RMSE of 2.06.

I compared my model’s worst and best predictions (in terms of absolute difference

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would be confident using the multiple regression model for abalones 
aged 12.5+ or younger, but for older abalones, I would either: 
- 1) Build a new model which takes into account the skewed performance on older abalones, or 
- 2) Stick to counting the shell rings under a microscope. :)
